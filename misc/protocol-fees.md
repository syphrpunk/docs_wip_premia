# Protocol Fees

The protocol must collect fees in order to grow and survive long-term. No fees are charged on deposit/withdrawal of liquidity from the Premia pools, rather, fees are charged when the pools facilitate a transaction between users.

**Option Purchase:** On option purchase, a protocol fee of 3% of the option's base price is charged to the buyer, included in the price quoted by the pool.

**Option Settlement:** On exercise, a protocol fee of 2.5% annual interest on the option's collateral value is collected from the pool for facilitating the utilization of capital.

As per community vote, 80% of all protocol fees are automatically collected and converted to PREMIA, which is then automatically distributed to xPREMIA holders (xPREMIA holders are PREMIA stakers). The remaining 20% of protocol fees are distributed to the PREMIA treasury, to be used for the further growth and development of the Premia ecosystem.

These fees help to maintain the [suite of tools](protocol-tools-and-expenses.md) that make the protocol so great and to ensure the long-term sustainability of the Premia protocol.
